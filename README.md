# 🐱🐶🦓🐴 Cat-Dog-Zebra-Horse Classifier using Simple CNN with Fine-Tuning

This project implements a **simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to distinguish between **cats and dogs**, and later **fine-tunes the pre-trained model** to additionally classify **zebras and horses**.

## 🚀 Project Summary

✅ Initially trained on **cat vs. dog dataset** to learn basic feature distinctions.  
✅ Later **fine-tuned with zebra and horse data** using transfer learning, evolving the model to classify four animals with minimal additional training.  
✅ Demonstrates **progressive model evolution** and **fine-tuning on small datasets** in a clear, educational pipeline.
